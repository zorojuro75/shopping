# E-Commerce App with Laravel backend and Nextjs frontend
## What is shooping?
<p> Shopping is an E-commerce online platform like all other online market places. In Shopping app:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are three product sections depending on the gender or age</li>
<li>Add products to the cart</li>
<li>See cart details</li>
<li>Create and login to your account</li>
</ol>

## What are the motivation?
<P>I have created shopping app in order to learn laravel and nextjs. I was working with nextjs and tailwind css for a while. But I was not using any backend framework yet. so in a hope to learn laravel and clearing my concept of OOP I have started this project.</P>
